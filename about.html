                    <h3>About</h3>
                    <p>Growing up I often heard from others about the importance of traveling. Traveling helps people become open-minded, compassionate, and more knowledgeable about other cultures. At the same time, I also saw firsthand what tourism has done to my beautiful home, Mexico. As I walk the streets now, all the signs are now in English, foreigners are throwing weddings using indigenous traditions as a cute theme, there is a demand for ‘banda’ music to be banned for disrupting the peace, and people are being forcibly relocated due to rising costs. Now as I walk the streets of a place I yearn to still call home, I feel like I no longer belong.</p>

                    <p>As a child, the idea of an outing for my mom was taking my sister and I to the library, especially on hot summer days when we didn’t want to turn on the AC. The hours I spent there allowed me to discover my love of reading and soon after I always needed a book in my hands.</p>

                    <p>These days, I still carry a book everywhere I go, but my tastes have definitely changed. I’m no longer reaching for the latest Diary of a Wimpy Kid book, but I can’t lie, sometimes I do want to. That said, in my undergraduate years as I witnessed the impacts of tourism and learned more about it, my interest in translated works began to grow. It granted me the opportunity to see the ways in which other people communicate their words and behaviors and to understand how other cultures' histories and current events impact their writing.</p>

                     <p>Now, I am on a journey of listening to the words of others, without inserting myself. I have a goal of reading one book from every country, in order to immerse myself in the unique perspectives and stories of individuals from around the world. I aim to understand not just the plot, but the cultural nuances, values, and struggles that resonate within those pages. It is a way for me to connect with the world beyond borders. This experience so far has turned reading into a more profound experience as a result, one that is as much about empathy and discovery as it is about enjoyment.</p>

                <h3>Rules to Accomplish my Goal</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The book must have originally been written in the most commonly spoken language in the country OR from an indigenous language. For example, if an author is from Japan, but they wrote a book in English, that does not count.</li>
                    <li>The book cannot be banned in the country of origin. Although banned books are definitely still read by people in their country of origin, they are less accessible, and the books I read have to be easier to access.</li>
                    <li>The book cannot be written by a politician, this is just a preference.</li>
                    <li>The book cannot be widely popular. I think it is fun researching and looking into what book I want to read next, so I do not want to opt for a novel that is so popular that it took me no effort to search for it. For instance, The Little Prince by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry. I love the book, but it does not count due to its popularity.</li>
                    <li>I need to take into account territories such as Puerto Rico and also read those as well.
