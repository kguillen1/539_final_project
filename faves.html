        <h2>My Favorite Books</h2>
      <p>This process has given me the opportunity to read so many amazing books, but there are a select few that have had an especially strong impact.</p>

                <h3>I’ll be Strong For You by Nasim Marashi (Iran)</h3>
                <blockquote>“Where in our origin story and with what force did our foundation crack so deep that, without even realizing it and with just one breeze, we crumbled down on top of ourselves unable to get back on our feet.”<br>― Nasim Marashi (trans. Poupeh Missaghi), <em>I’ll Be Strong For You</em></blockquote>
                <p>This is a masterpiece and it also happens to be my all time favorite book! The book tells the story of three friends in Tehran, Iran, navigating their lives in the years after graduating college. It is so deeply moving and I feel that any girl or woman that picks this up will be able to relate to at least one of the characters. It shows the difficulties of having to grow up and the regrets that come along the way. Despite there being so much pain and not really having a “happy ending,” it feels comforting to know that there is someone out there that feels and thinks just like me.</p>

            <img src="images/my_brilliant_friend.jpg" alt="My Brilliant Friend book cover"  class="book-cover" width="200" height="300">

            <div class="book-text">
                <h3>My Brilliant Friend by Elena Ferrante (Italy)</h3>
                <blockquote>“I feel no nostalgia for our childhood: it was full of violence... we grew up with the duty to make it difficult for others before they made it difficult for us.”<br>― Elena Ferrante (trans. Ann Goldstein), <em>My Brilliant Friend</em></blockquote>
                <p>LISTEN! I know I said that I was not going to pick up widely popular books, but I couldn't help it. Despite this book being well-known, it still feels underrated and I need to talk about it.</p>

                <p>First, the book cover? It’s hideous and I love it with all my heart. That’s the point. Oftentimes women’s writing gets categorized into women’s fiction and is looked down upon for it. With this cover, Elena seeks to subvert one’s expectations to make the audience look beyond surface-level judgements. She is not interested in selling beauty or a fantasy, but rather highlighting how women are overlooked, silenced, and erased. This is even more poignant when taking into consideration that no one knows who Elena is. She is anonymous and the name is a pseudonym. This book is considered so well written that various critics have come out to say that there is no way that this book could have been written by a woman. The rumors spread so much that Elena had to come out with a statement declaring that she is a woman.</p>

                <p>The book follows two friends in the years after World War II, growing up in their poor neighborhood in Naples and into adulthood. It touches on issues relating to violence, complex female friendships, and poverty. </p>

            <img src="images/sweet_bean.jpg" alt="Sweet Bean Paste book cover"  class="book-cover" width="200" height="300">

            <div class="book-text">
                <h3>Sweet Bean Paste by Durian Sukegawa (Japan)</h3>
                <blockquote>“All experience adds up to a life lived as only you could. I feel sure the day will come when you can say: this is my life.”<br>― Durian Sukegawa (trans. Alison Watts ), <em>Sweet Bean Paste</em></blockquote>
                <p>I physically cannot talk about this book and it’s the truth. I first watched the movie and when I tried to explain the plot to someone, I could barely get the words out before breaking out into a sob. Soon after I finally read the book and when I tried to explain it to someone I also broke out into tears. All I am going to say before going on a tangent is that this book is about a reclusive man that has a dorayaki (pancake like bread with red bean paste filling) shop. One day an older woman approaches him asking if she can work for him.</p>

            <img src="images/heaven_edit.jpg" alt="Heaven Official's Blessing book cover"  class="book-cover" width="200" height="300">

            <div class="book-text">
            <h3>Heaven Official’s Blessing by Mo Xiang Tong Xiu (China)</h3>
            <blockquote>“The one standing in infinite glory is you; the one fallen from grace is also you. What matters is ‘you’ and not the state of you.”<br>― Mo Xiang Tong Xiu (trans. Suika), <em>Heaven Official’s Blessing</em></blockquote>
            <p>Did you know that Heaven Official’s Blessing has a word count of 750,000? For reference, Les Miserables by Victor Hugo has 560,000 words, War and Peace by Leo Tolstoy has 567,00 words, and The Lord of the Rings by J. R. R. Tolkien has 564,000 words. This book, originally published online, is so long that it has been broken up into 8 volumes for traditional publishing.</p>

            <p> Anyone that knows me, knows that I do not like or read romance novels. I appreciate and respect the genre, but it is very difficult for me to find the tropes and themes that I love. That said, this is everything I could ever ask in a romance, it's a slow burn mixed with horror, action, and thrills. And while I do not know Chinese, this book proves that translation truly is an art. There are a lot of mentions of Chinese mythology as well as a wide range of terms to refer to specific people, but the translator manages to seamlessly write in an accessible way.</p>
